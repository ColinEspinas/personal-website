      A bit about me
    </h1>
    <p class="leading-[30px] text-dark-1">
      Hello, I’m an open source enthousiast currently working as a Full Stack
      Web Developer at Netatmo where I create awesome web experiences for our
      users and am a student in Web and Mobile Engineering at IIM Digital School
      in Paris. I strive to make the web more open, accessible and beautiful by
      crafting tools and experiences for everyone to enjoy.

    <Section title="Things I work on">
      <p class="text-dark-1">
        Those are the subjects I am the most susceptible to work on and write
        about.
      </p>
      <p class="text-dark-1">
        I remain open to any experiences outside of those subjects and am always
        ready to learn more.

    <Section title="Technologies I like to work with">
      <p class="text-dark-1">
        I don’t like limiting myself to a specific tech stack but here is a
        non-exhaustive list of technologies I tend to work with.
      </p>
      <p class="text-dark-1">
        I also like to work from scratch and make my own tools when I get the
        occasion, creating frameworks and libraries is one of my hobbies.
      </p>
      <p class="text-dark-1">
        I am not scared to learn new things as the ecosystem progresses and am
        always interested by new ideas.
